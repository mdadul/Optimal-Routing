# OPTIMAL ROUTING AND THROUGHPUT ANALYSIS IN RANDOM ROUTING 
In many different fields, such as computer networks, transportation systems, and logistics, random routing networks are widely used. Random routing networks lack a predefined structure, in contrast to conventional, static routing networks, and routing choices are made instantly based on dynamic data. In these networks, it is essential to analyze throughput and optimize routing in order to increase efficiency and dependability.

In this project, we focus on the Dijkstra algorithm, a widely used algorithm for finding the shortest path in networks. We examine its applicability and performance in random routing networks.
